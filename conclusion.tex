\todo{
Talk about the limitations of our approach, coarse grained dependency tracking. Solution: large number of partitions.

Say again what we introduced (a consistency model, a protocol an its implementation, an evaluation), and what we took out of it -> read aborts? performance related to RC and SER.

Future work: ``in the future we hope to propose algorithms for automatically inferring entity groups required for an application to satisfy our robustness criterion.'' (from SPSI paper)

Also, could use something like RAMP's repair read when the clients sends several reads at the same time, if we encounter a read abort.
