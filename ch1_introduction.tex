\todo{
What's a distributed database, and why do we need them? -> Large amounts of data, need to distribute data among servers to handle load and have better latency/service for clients.

What problems does this introduce? -> Lack of consistency, difficult for programmers to reason about these models.

What's consistency? -> Programmers want easy to understand models, and transactions are useful.

Systems that offer strong consistency are usually slow, so we focus on a model between strong and weak consistency, and show that an implementation can achieve performance close to the offered by weak consistent systems, but without their limitations.

Mention previous work (NMSI), and how we differ from them (vector clocks vs dependence vectors)

Overview of what we're covering in the thesis: explanation of the model (PSI/NSMI), an implementation of the protocol, and a comparative evaluation. Link to the code on github.
