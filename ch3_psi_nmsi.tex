\chapter{PSI/NMSI}

\todo{
We explain what PSI is, how it differs from classical SI, and how it avoids some of the anomalies explained during the preliminaries. Explain the protocol in terms of abstract executions.

PSI = SI (isolation) + Causal consistency (consistency) => ref Lamport
Traditional SI = Sequential consistency?
